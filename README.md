# Utah Time-Series-Analysis
Time Series Analysis of Weather in Utah, USA

This repository contains code for conducting time series analysis of weather data in Utah. The analysis is performed using the R programming language and several R packages.

## Dataset
The weather data is obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and is stored in a CSV file format. The data covers a period of over 100 years, from 1895 to 2020.


## Analysis
The analysis of this dataset is done using R language, with various time series analysis techniques applied. The analysis includes plotting different time series graphs to observe the patterns in snowfall, temperature, and rainfall. Data analysis techniques line aggregation and decomposition have also been used. Ultimately the seasonality in the dataset is observed.

Autocorrelation and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests were conducted to examine the stationarity of the time series. The results show that the temperature time series is stationary, which means that it is not dependent on time.


## Conclusion
The analysis shows that Utah's weather patterns have changed significantly over the past 100 years. The temperature time series was found to be stationary, which means that it is not dependent on time. This repository serves as a reference for anyone interested in analyzing weather patterns in Utah, USA, or similar datasets.
